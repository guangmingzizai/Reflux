## Overview

Unidirectional dataflow has many benefits, especially in large applications. The complexity of application is proportional to dataflow's messiness.

Declarative programming style is also a key point of the library.

I strongly advise you to read the  [Flux in depth overivew](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview.html#content).
